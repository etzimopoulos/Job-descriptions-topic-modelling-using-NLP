      "Management Executives of a growing healthcare management firm are seeking a top-notch Executive Assistant with some experience in accounting as well.  The right person for this position will be expected to perform clerical support work for the executives, including standard duties such as managing phone, mail and email correspondence, filing and other day-to-day responsibilities.  In addition this person will be expected to keep up-to-date financial records and provide cash management for both personal and business related activities of the Executives.  This position can be at times demanding and challenging, requiring the right candidate to be efficient with multi-tasking as well as organized.  There will likely be much interaction with co-workers and with customers/acquaintences which will require a mastery of inter-personal skills and an understanding of the various personal and business interests of the Executives.  Although the hours for this position are generally regular business hours, at times the position will require some flexibility in the work schedule in order to accommodate the Executives schedules.  The ideal candidate for this position will come with experience in a similar position, looking to grow with a relatively young management company.\n"
